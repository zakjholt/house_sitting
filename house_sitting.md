# House sitting summary


## Wake up and bed time
---

- Dogs will usually wake up and let you know they have to go out around 7am.
- Bedtime, they just go in their crates. Whenever you go to bed is fine.


## Dog meals
---

### Breakfast

- Finch gets 3 spoonfulls of canned food. Extra cans are above the pantry
- Henry gets one mason jar scoop of dry food. It's in the food container. His bowl should have an overturned bowl inside of it. This is just to slow him down, otherwise he'll choke.
- Cats have automatic feeders that go off at 6am. Nothing ya need to do for them in the mornings.

> Bonnie will sometimes try to steal Finch's food. Just keep an eye on it to make sure she doesn't get bullied out.


### Dinner

- Using Henry's bowl, fill one scoop of dehydrated food (it's in the container)
- Add 2-3 seconds of water from the faucet, set down to soak
- Grab a fork, and a can of cat food from above the pantry.
- Each cat gets half a can.
- With a little water, get some of the dregs from the cat food can, add to the dog food bowl
- Pour a bit of the food from Henry's bowl into Finch's. Then feed Henry.

## When you go out

- Put them in their crates when/if you leave. Try to keep it to like 5 hours max. We usually grab a greenie each and tell them to go to crates. Henry is good, Finch might just need to be picked up


## Litter

- The cats have an automatic litterbox, so it should be fine. Just check it once in awhile to make sure it has litter in it. If it's low, toss a scoop in.
